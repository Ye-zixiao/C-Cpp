When I see my classmates wearing beautiful clothes and looking 
so attractive I wish I could be one of them In my eyes they are so

to accept the shortcomings Indeed I find the imperfection of my friends
and believe in what my mother says Life will be much happier if we accept
the whole sides of ourselves
